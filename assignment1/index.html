            <li>I learned that in order to construct a user-friendly website, 
                I need to consider the users' intents and the logic behind the functions,
                and then utilize the styling tools to guide the users. 
                One can learn a lot by observing other successful interface design.</li>
            <li>I really like the part about Spotify. I am a Spotify user for quite a few year
                and always think Spotify is very easy-to-use. 
                I think the analysis in this section makes a lot of sense.
