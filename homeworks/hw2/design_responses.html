						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I learned that using white spaces properly is very benefitial as it guides users' attention and emphaize on certain elements.
								In this article, the demonstrations are comparisons are very convincing. I truly understand how white spaces are useful and 
								gained some ideas on how to use whitespace to make the interface page more organized. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I found the part about the "multiple of 8 pixels" rule very interesting. I agree that within small aestheically details, there are 
								scientific facts about human psychology or cognition that make one layout better than the others. I think this is interesting due to 
								the shared sense of aestheic among the entire human species.
							</p>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> "Think of white space as a breath of fresh air. Just as humans need air to breathe, designs need white space to breathe. " </p>
